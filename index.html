    <h2 class="center">Movie:</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favorite movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Train_(film)" target="_blank">Bullet Train</a>. Bullet Train is a comedy action movie
      about many criminals all trying to kill eachother and stay alive on a
      high-speed Bullet Train. The main charcter is known to have bad luck and
      just ends up on the train with a bunch of murders. This is my favorite
      movie because of the shocking plot twist and turn of events near the end
      of the film. I first watched this on a plane to India and have watched in
      several times since. It is my go-to movie every single time I show someone
      a movie, and they always end up liking it too.

    <h2 class="center">Sport:</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favorite sport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton" target="_blank"> Badminton</a>. Badminton is a sport that uses two or four
      players hitting a birdy with rackets, there is usally a net between them.
      I love badminton because I find it really fun. I usally play with my older
      sister in the front yard and the games go on for what feels like hours. We
      played a lot of badminton this year mostly on the days when is wasn't
      raining. I love playing badminton because I find it really fun and
      enjoyable.
